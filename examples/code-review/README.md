# Code Review Example

Collaborative code review with persistent feedback tracking. Issues are tracked across sessions, and fixes are applied iteratively.

## What This Demonstrates

### 1. Iterative Review Process
Code review isn't one-shot—it's iterative:

```bash
Session 1: "Review for security issues"
Session 2: "Now check performance"
Session 3: "Apply the suggested fixes"
Session 4: "Re-review the fixed code"
```

### 2. Issue Tracking
Issues persist across sessions:

```markdown
# issues.md

## Security Review - 2024-01-15

### Critical: SQL Injection in user.ts:45
- Location: `getUserById` function
- Risk: User input directly in query
- Fix: Use parameterized queries

### High: Missing input validation
...
```

### 3. Review History
Complete audit trail:

```markdown
# review-log.md

## Session 1 - 2024-01-15
- Added auth.ts for review
- Added user.ts for review
- Ran security review
- Applied fix: SQL injection in user.ts

## Session 2 - 2024-01-16
- Ran performance review
...
```

### 4. Artifact Evolution
Code improves through iterations:

```
user.ts
├── v1: Original code
├── v2: Fixed SQL injection
├── v3: Added input validation
└── v4: Performance optimized
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Start reviewing
pnpm start
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `add <file>` | Add code file for review |
| `review` | Comprehensive review |
| `security` | Security-focused review |
| `performance` | Performance-focused review |
| `style` | Code style review |
| `fix <issue>` | Apply a fix |
| `issues` | List all issues |
| `summary` | Generate review summary |
| `quit` | Save and exit |

## Security Issues Found

### Critical: Hardcoded API Key (line 12)
The API key is hardcoded in the source code.
**Fix:** Use environment variables.

### High: No Rate Limiting
The login endpoint has no rate limiting.
**Fix:** Implement rate limiting middleware.

if (!API_KEY) {
  throw new Error("API_KEY environment variable required");
}
```

💻 You: quit

## Why This Matters

Traditional code review tools:
- ❌ Issues tracked separately from code
- ❌ No persistent context
- ❌ Manual fix application

Vibex Code Review:
- ✅ Issues tracked with code
- ✅ Full review history
- ✅ AI-assisted fixes
- ✅ Iterative improvement
