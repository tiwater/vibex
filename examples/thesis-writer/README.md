# Thesis Writer Example

This example demonstrates VibeX's core capability: **persistent workspaces where documents evolve through continuous collaboration across sessions**.

## What This Demonstrates

### 1. Multi-Session Persistence

Unlike traditional AI assistants that forget everything after each conversation, VibeX maintains complete context across sessions:

```bash
# Day 1: Start your thesis
pnpm start
> "Write the introduction chapter"

# Day 2: Continue where you left off
pnpm start
> "Make the introduction more concise"
# XAgent remembers everything from Day 1!
```

### 2. Artifact Evolution

Your thesis isn't just created—it evolves:

```
thesis.md
├── v1: Initial draft
├── v2: More concise introduction
├── v3: Added citations
└── v4: Final polish
```

### 3. Context Accumulation

Each conversation builds on previous ones:

```
Session 1: "Research climate change impacts"
Session 2: "Focus on agriculture" (knows about climate change)
Session 3: "Write conclusions" (knows everything discussed)
```

### 4. Plan Adaptation

The plan evolves based on your feedback:

```
Initial Plan:
1. Research → 2. Outline → 3. Draft → 4. Review

After feedback "Skip outline, I have one":
1. Research → 2. Draft (use existing outline) → 3. Review
```

## Getting Started

1. **Set up environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start writing**
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```
