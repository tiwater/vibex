## Step 1: Project Setup

Let's create a new project for our collaborative writing team:

```bash
mkdir writer-reviewer-team
cd writer-reviewer-team
mkdir -p config/prompts
mkdir taskspace
```

Your project structure:

```
writer-reviewer-team/
├── config/
│   ├── team.yaml           # Team configuration
│   └── prompts/
│       ├── writer.md       # Writer agent prompt
│       └── reviewer.md     # Reviewer agent prompt
├── taskspace/              # Working directory
└── main.py                 # Main application
```

## Step 2: Team Configuration

Multi-agent systems require more sophisticated configuration. Create `config/team.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "writer_reviewer_team"
description: "A collaborative writing team with writer and reviewer agents"

# Define multiple agents with different roles
agents:
  - name: "writer"
    description: "Creative content writer"
    prompt_template: "prompts/writer.md"
    tools: ["handoff"]
    llm_config:
      provider: "deepseek"
      model: "deepseek-chat"
      temperature: 0.8 # More creative for writing
      max_tokens: 4000

  - name: "reviewer"
    description: "Content reviewer and editor"
    prompt_template: "prompts/reviewer.md"
    tools: ["handoff"]
    llm_config:
      provider: "deepseek"
      model: "deepseek-chat"
      temperature: 0.3 # More focused for reviewing
      max_tokens: 4000

# Enable handoff tool for agent collaboration
tools:
  - name: "handoff"
    type: "builtin"

# Execution configuration for multi-agent workflows
execution:
  mode: "autonomous"
  initial_agent: "writer" # Start with the writer
  max_rounds: 6 # Allow multiple handoffs
  timeout_seconds: 600

# Enable orchestrator with intelligent routing
orchestrator:
  max_rounds: 6
  timeout: 600
  brain_config:
    model: "deepseek/deepseek-chat"
    temperature: 0.0
    max_tokens: 150
```

### New Configuration Concepts

- **Multiple agents**: Each with specialized roles and different temperatures
- **Handoff tool**: Enables agents to pass work between each other
- **Initial agent**: Which agent starts the workflow
- **Orchestrator**: Manages agent coordination and routing decisions

## Step 3: Writer Agent Prompt

The writer focuses on creating engaging content. Create `config/prompts/writer.md`:

```markdown
# Content Writer

You are a skilled content writer specializing in creating engaging, informative articles.

## Your Role

- Write clear, engaging content on requested topics
- Use storytelling techniques to make content interesting
- Structure content with proper headings and flow
- Write in a conversational, accessible tone

## Process

1. Analyze the writing request carefully
2. Create an outline (mental or explicit)
3. Write the content with proper structure
4. When finished, hand off to the reviewer for feedback

## Handoff Instructions

When you complete your first draft, use the handoff tool to pass your work to the "reviewer" agent:

- Explain what you've written
- Ask for specific feedback
- Be open to collaboration

## Output Format

Structure your content with:

- Clear headings (use ## for main sections)
- Short paragraphs for readability
- Bullet points where appropriate
- Engaging introduction and conclusion

## Example Handoff

When ready for review, say something like:
"I've completed a draft article about [topic]. I've structured it with an engaging introduction, three main sections covering [key points], and a strong conclusion. Could you please review it for clarity, flow, and overall quality? I'm particularly interested in feedback on [specific area]."

Then use the handoff tool to transfer to the reviewer.
```

## Step 4: Reviewer Agent Prompt

The reviewer focuses on improving content quality. Create `config/prompts/reviewer.md`:

```markdown
# Content Reviewer & Editor

You are an experienced editor who improves content quality and provides constructive feedback.

## Your Role

- Review content for clarity, accuracy, and engagement
- Suggest improvements for structure and flow
- Check for grammar and style consistency
- Provide specific, actionable feedback

## Review Process

1. Read the content thoroughly
2. Identify strengths and areas for improvement
3. Provide specific suggestions with examples
4. If major revisions needed, hand back to writer
5. If content is good, approve and finalize

## Feedback Guidelines

- Be constructive and specific
- Explain WHY changes are needed
- Suggest concrete improvements
- Acknowledge what works well
- Focus on clarity and reader experience

## Handoff Decision

- **Hand back to writer**: If content needs significant revision
- **Finalize**: If content meets quality standards with minor notes

## Example Review Process

1. Start with positive feedback: "This is a strong draft with [specific strengths]..."
2. Provide specific suggestions: "To improve clarity in section 2, consider..."
3. Make your decision: Either hand back with revision requests or approve the final version

Use the handoff tool to communicate your decision and feedback.
```

## Step 5: Main Application with Collaboration Tracking

Create `main.py` to observe the collaboration in action:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from vibex import execute_task

async def main():
    print("✍️  Writer-Reviewer Team Demo")
    print("Watch as our agents collaborate to create great content!\n")

    config_path = str(Path(__file__).parent / "config" / "team.yaml")

    # Get writing topic from user
    topic = input("What would you like an article about? ").strip()
    if not topic:
        topic = "the benefits of remote work"

    prompt = f"Write a 400-word article about: {topic}"

    print(f"\n🎬 Starting collaboration on: {topic}")
    print("=" * 50)

    try:
        # Track the collaboration process
        handoff_count = 0
        current_agent = "writer"

        async for update in execute_task(prompt, config_path, stream=True):
            update_type = update.get("type")

            if update_type == "content":
                print(update["content"], end="", flush=True)

            elif update_type == "handoff":
                handoff_count += 1
                from_agent = update["from_agent"]
                to_agent = update["to_agent"]
                current_agent = to_agent

                print(f"\n\n🔄 HANDOFF #{handoff_count}: {from_agent} → {to_agent}")
                print("─" * 30)

            elif update_type == "routing_decision":
                if update["action"] == "complete":
                    print(f"\n\n🎉 Collaboration complete!")
                    print(f"📊 Total handoffs: {handoff_count}")
                    print(f"🎯 Final agent: {current_agent}")
                    break

        print(f"\n\n✅ Article finished! The team worked together to create great content.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Code Highlights

- **Collaboration tracking**: Monitor handoffs between agents
- **Real-time updates**: See the workflow as it happens
- **User input**: Let users choose the writing topic
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of issues

## Step 6: Run the Collaborative Team

```bash
# Set your API key
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the team
python main.py
```

You'll see something like:

```
✍️  Writer-Reviewer Team Demo
Watch as our agents collaborate to create great content!

What would you like an article about? artificial intelligence trends

🎬 Starting collaboration on: artificial intelligence trends
==================================================
```

## Step 7: Watch the Magic Happen

Here's what you'll observe during the collaboration:

### Phase 1: Writer Creates Content

The writer will:

- Analyze the topic
- Create structured content
- Write engaging introduction and conclusion
- Prepare to hand off to reviewer

### Phase 2: Handoff to Reviewer

You'll see:

```
🔄 HANDOFF #1: writer → reviewer
──────────────────────────────
```

### Phase 3: Reviewer Provides Feedback

The reviewer will:

- Analyze the content quality
- Provide specific feedback
- Either approve or request revisions

### Phase 4: Potential Revision Cycle

If revisions are needed:

```
🔄 HANDOFF #2: reviewer → writer
──────────────────────────────
```

## 🎉 Congratulations!

### Preview: What You'll Build Next

- **Custom weather tool** that gets real-time data
- **Agent with external API access** for enhanced capabilities
- **Tool integration patterns** for extending functionality
- **Advanced agent capabilities** beyond text generation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Agents not handing off?**

- Check that the handoff tool is configured correctly
- Verify agents understand when to use handoffs
- Look at the prompts to ensure handoff instructions are clear

**Workflow getting stuck?**

- Check the max_rounds setting
- Verify timeout configuration
- Look for infinite loops in handoff logic

**Want to experiment?**

- Try different temperature settings for different creative levels
- Add a third agent (like a fact-checker or editor)
- Modify prompts to change collaboration patterns
- Test with different types of content
