## Step 1: Project Setup

Create a new project for your weather-enabled assistant:

```bash
mkdir weather-assistant
cd weather-assistant
mkdir -p config/prompts
mkdir taskspace
```

Your project structure:

```
weather-assistant/
├── config/
│   ├── team.yaml           # Agent configuration
│   └── prompts/
│       └── assistant.md    # Assistant prompt
├── weather_tool.py         # Custom weather tool
├── main.py                 # Main application
└── taskspace/              # Working directory
```

## Step 2: Create a Custom Weather Tool

The heart of this tutorial is building a custom tool. Create `weather_tool.py`:

```python
import aiohttp
from typing import Dict, Any
from vibex import Tool, tool

class WeatherTool(Tool):
    """Custom weather tool using Open-Meteo API (no API key required)."""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.base_url = "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast"
        self.geocoding_url = "https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search"

    @tool(
        description="Get current weather for a specific location",
        return_description="Weather information as a formatted string"
    )
    async def get_weather(self, location: str) -> str:
        """
        Get current weather for a location.

        Args:
            location: City name, e.g., "San Francisco" or "London, UK"

        Returns:
            Weather information as a formatted string
        """
        try:
            # Get coordinates for the location
            coords = await self._get_coordinates(location)
            if not coords:
                return f"Sorry, I couldn't find the location '{location}'. Please try a more specific location name."

            # Get weather data
            weather = await self._get_weather_data(coords)
            if not weather:
                return f"Sorry, I couldn't get weather data for {location}. Please try again later."

            return self._format_weather(location, weather, coords)

        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error getting weather for {location}: {str(e)}"

    async def _get_coordinates(self, location: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get latitude and longitude for a location."""
        try:
            async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:

                    if response.status == 200:
                        data = await response.json()
                        if data.get("results") and len(data["results"]) > 0:

        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error formatting weather data: {str(e)}"

    def _get_weather_description(self, code: int) -> str:

        return weather_codes.get(code, f"Unknown conditions (code: {code})")
```

### Understanding the Tool

- **Inherits from Tool**: All custom tools extend the VibeX `Tool` base class
- **Async methods**: Uses `async/await` for non-blocking API calls
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of network and API errors
- **Structured data**: Converts raw API data into readable format
- **No API key required**: Uses free Open-Meteo API

## Step 3: Agent Configuration with Custom Tool

Create `config/team.yaml` to integrate your custom tool:

```yaml
name: "weather_assistant"
description: "AI assistant with weather capabilities"

agents:
  - name: "assistant"
    description: "Helpful assistant with weather tools"
    prompt_template: "prompts/assistant.md"
    tools: ["weather"] # Reference our custom tool
    llm_config:
      provider: "deepseek"
      model: "deepseek-chat"
      temperature: 0.7
      max_tokens: 4000
      supports_function_calls: true

# Configure the custom tool
tools:
  - name: "weather"
    type: "custom"
    module: "weather_tool" # Python file name
    class: "WeatherTool" # Class name

execution:
  mode: "autonomous"
  initial_agent: "assistant"
  max_rounds: 10
  timeout_seconds: 300

memory:
  enabled: false
```

### Configuration Highlights

- **Custom tool type**: `type: "custom"` tells VibeX this is a custom tool
- **Module and class**: Points to your Python file and class
- **Tool reference**: Agent lists "weather" in its tools array

## Step 4: Agent Prompt with Tool Instructions

Create `config/prompts/assistant.md`:

```markdown
# Weather Assistant

You are a helpful AI assistant with access to real-time weather information.

## Your Capabilities

- Answer general questions about any topic
- Get current weather for any location using your weather tool
- Provide weather-related advice and insights
- Help users plan activities based on weather conditions

## Using the Weather Tool

When users ask about weather:

1. Use the `get_weather` function with the location they specify
2. Present the information in a friendly, conversational way
3. Offer relevant advice based on the weather conditions

## Examples of Weather Queries

- "What's the weather in Tokyo?" → Use get_weather("Tokyo")
- "How's the weather looking in New York City?" → Use get_weather("New York City")
- "Tell me about the weather in London, UK" → Use get_weather("London, UK")

## Response Guidelines

- Be friendly and conversational
- Explain weather conditions in practical terms
- Offer suggestions when appropriate (e.g., "Great weather for a walk!")
- If weather data isn't available, suggest alternatives or ask for clarification
- Always acknowledge the data source when providing weather information

## Non-Weather Queries

For questions not related to weather, respond normally as a helpful assistant.
You don't need to use the weather tool for every conversation.

## Example Interactions

**User**: "What's the weather like in Paris?"
**You**: I'll check the current weather in Paris for you.
_[Use get_weather("Paris")]_
Based on the weather data, it's currently [temperature] with [conditions]. [Add relevant advice or observations]

**User**: "Should I bring an umbrella to London today?"
**You**: Let me check the current weather conditions in London to help you decide.
_[Use get_weather("London")]_
[Provide recommendation based on weather data]
```

## Step 5: Main Application with Tool Demonstration

Create `main.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Add current directory to path for custom tool import
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))

from vibex.core.task import TaskExecutor

async def main():
    print("🌤️  Weather Assistant")
    print("Ask me about the weather anywhere in the world!")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit\n")

    config_path = Path(__file__).parent / "config" / "team.yaml"
    task_executor = TaskExecutor(str(config_path))

    # Show some example questions
    print("💡 Try asking:")
    print("  - What's the weather in Paris?")
    print("  - How's the weather in Tokyo today?")
    print("  - Should I bring a jacket in London?")
    print("  - Tell me about the weather in your city")
    print("  - Or ask me anything else!")
    print()

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").strip()
        if user_input.lower() in ['quit', 'q', 'exit']:
            print("Goodbye! Stay dry! 🌂")
            break

        print("Assistant: ", end="", flush=True)
        try:
            async for chunk in task_executor.execute_task(user_input, stream=True):
                if chunk.get("type") == "content":
                    print(chunk.get("content", ""), end="", flush=True)
            print("\n")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"\n❌ Error: {e}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Code Features

- **Path management**: Ensures Python can find your custom tool
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of tool errors
- **User guidance**: Shows example queries to help users
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time display of agent responses

## Step 6: Install Dependencies and Run

```bash
# Install required dependency for HTTP requests
pip install aiohttp

# Set your API key
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run your weather assistant
python main.py
```

## Step 7: Test Your Custom Tool

Try these example interactions:

### Weather Queries

```
You: What's the weather in San Francisco?
Assistant: I'll check the current weather in San Francisco for you.

🌤️ Current Weather for San Francisco, United States:
🌡️ Temperature: 18°C
💧 Humidity: 65%
💨 Wind Speed: 12 km/h
☁️ Conditions: Partly cloudy

It's a pleasant day in San Francisco! The partly cloudy conditions and mild temperature make it perfect for outdoor activities.
```

### Planning Questions

```
You: Should I bring a jacket to London today?
Assistant: Let me check the current weather conditions in London to help you decide.

🌤️ Current Weather for London, United Kingdom:
🌡️ Temperature: 8°C
💧 Humidity: 78%
💨 Wind Speed: 15 km/h
☁️ Conditions: Overcast

Yes, I'd definitely recommend bringing a jacket! At 8°C with overcast conditions, it's quite cool in London today.
```

### Non-Weather Questions

```
You: Can you explain how APIs work?
Assistant: Absolutely! APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are like bridges that allow different software applications to communicate with each other...
```

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've successfully built an agent with custom capabilities! Here's what you accomplished:

✅ **Created a custom tool** that connects to external APIs
✅ **Integrated the tool** with your agent configuration
✅ **Handled async operations** for non-blocking API calls
✅ **Implemented error handling** for robust tool behavior
✅ **Built a practical application** that provides real value

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned

- **Custom Tool Development**: Extending agent capabilities with Python classes
- **Tool Integration**: How agents discover and use custom tools
- **External APIs**: Connecting to real-world data sources
- **Async Programming**: Handling network requests without blocking
- **Error Handling**: Building resilient tools that handle failures gracefully

## 🔍 Understanding Tool Architecture

### How Tools Work

1. **Agent receives request**: User asks about weather
2. **LLM decides to use tool**: Based on the prompt and request
3. **Tool is invoked**: VibeX calls your `get_weather` method
4. **Tool processes request**: Makes API calls and formats data
5. **Agent uses result**: Incorporates tool output into response

### Tool Design Principles

- **Single responsibility**: Each tool should do one thing well
- **Clear interfaces**: Well-documented methods with type hints
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of all failure modes
- **Async support**: Non-blocking operations for better performance
- **Testability**: Easy to test in isolation

## 🚀 What's Next?

You've mastered custom tools, but now let's scale up! In [Tutorial 4: Production Systems](/docs/tutorials/4-production), you'll build a comprehensive, production-ready system with multiple agents, persistent memory, and enterprise features.

### Preview: What You'll Build Next

- **Multi-agent research system** with specialized roles
- **Persistent memory** for long-term context
- **Advanced error handling** and monitoring
- **Production deployment patterns** for real applications
- **File operations** and deliverable generation

## 🔧 Advanced Tool Development

### Adding More Methods

You can add multiple methods to a single tool:

```python
class WeatherTool(Tool):
    @tool(description="Get current weather for a location")
    async def get_weather(self, location: str) -> str:
        # Current weather

    @tool(description="Get multi-day weather forecast")
    async def get_forecast(self, location: str, days: int = 5) -> str:
        # Multi-day forecast

    @tool(description="Get weather warnings and alerts")
    async def get_weather_alerts(self, location: str) -> str:
        # Weather warnings and alerts
```

### Tool Configuration

Tools can accept configuration parameters:

```yaml
tools:
  - name: "weather"
    type: "custom"
    module: "weather_tool"
    class: "WeatherTool"
    config:
      api_timeout: 30
      default_units: "metric"
```

### Error Handling Best Practices

- Always use try-catch blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Have fallback responses
- Validate input parameters

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Tool not being called?**

- **CRITICAL**: Ensure all tool methods have the `@tool` decorator
- Check the agent's tools list includes your tool name
- Verify the prompt mentions when to use the tool
- Ensure the tool is properly configured in team.yaml

**Import errors?**

- Check that sys.path includes your project directory
- Verify module and class names match exactly
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

**API errors?**

- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API endpoint is working
- Look at error messages for specific issues
- Test the API directly in a browser

**Want to build more tools?**

- Try a news API for current events
- Build a calculator for math operations
- Create a file operations tool
- Add database connectivity
