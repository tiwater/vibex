## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorials, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js 18+** installed
2. **pnpm** installed (`npm install -g pnpm`)
3. **API Key** — OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek
4. **Basic TypeScript knowledge** — understanding of async/await is helpful

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Create a new project
mkdir my-vibex-project
cd my-vibex-project
pnpm init

# Install dependencies
pnpm add vibex dotenv

# Install dev dependencies
pnpm add -D typescript tsx @types/node

# Create tsconfig.json
echo '{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}' > tsconfig.json

# Create .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
```

### Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start with Tutorial 1** — Even if you're experienced, this establishes the VibeX patterns
