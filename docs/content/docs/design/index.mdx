# VibeX Design & Architecture

Welcome to the VibeX design documentation! This section provides comprehensive technical insights into how VibeX works internally, its architectural decisions, and the principles that guide its development.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy: Space-Oriented Collaboration

**VibeX is fundamentally different from task-oriented agent frameworks.**

Most agent frameworks follow a "fire-and-forget" pattern:

```
User → "Do X" → Plan → Execute → Result → END
```

VibeX follows a **persistent, evolving workspace** pattern:

```
User → Space → XAgent → [Iterate on Artifacts] → [Continue Tomorrow] → [Evolve Further]
              ↑                                          ↓
              └────────── Persistent State ──────────────┘
```

### Why Space-Oriented?

Real-world work is iterative. You don't write a document once—you draft, review, refine, and polish. VibeX is designed for this reality:

- **Persistent Spaces**: Your work survives across sessions
- **Evolving Artifacts**: Documents, code, and data improve over time
- **Continuous Collaboration**: Talk to XAgent today, continue tomorrow
- **Accumulated Context**: The system remembers everything about your project

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

VibeX is built as a **collaborative workspace platform** that orchestrates specialized agents in a secure, observable, and scalable manner. Unlike task runners, VibeX maintains persistent state and enables continuous iteration on artifacts.

### Key Design Principles

- **Space-Centric** - All work happens within persistent Spaces that survive across sessions
- **Artifact Evolution** - Documents and files are living entities that improve over time
- **Continuous Collaboration** - Users interact with XAgent in ongoing conversations
- **Session Continuity** - Return to your work tomorrow with full context preserved
- **Agent Autonomy** - Agents manage their own reasoning with private context
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Asynchronous, structured communication
- **Configuration-Driven** - Declarative agent and workflow definitions
- **Security by Design** - Audited, policy-enforced external interactions

### [Memory & Context](/docs/design/memory)

Understanding the persistent memory system in VibeX, combining Space-scoped history with AI-friendly semantic memory.

### [Tool Execution](/docs/design/tool-execution)

Detailed explanation of the secure tool execution system, including validation, sandboxing, and the tool self-correction mechanism.

### [Communication Patterns](/docs/design/communication)

Event-driven communication architecture, message passing patterns, and how agents coordinate through XAgent.

### [Security](/docs/design/security)

Overview of the security model, including Space isolation, tool permissions, and audit logging.

## 🎯 Key Architectural Components

### Space

The **persistent container** for all work. A Space holds:

- Artifacts (documents, code, data)
- Conversation history across sessions
- Configuration and preferences
- Version history of all changes

### XAgent

The **project manager** for each Space. XAgent:

- Remembers the entire project history
- Knows all artifacts in the Space
- Coordinates specialist agents
- Adapts plans based on evolving requirements

### Specialist Agents

Single-purpose experts (Writer, Researcher, Developer, etc.) that XAgent delegates to. Each agent:

- Has one clear responsibility
- Operates on artifacts within the Space
- Reports results back to XAgent

### Workflow Engine

The runtime kernel for complex multi-step operations. Used when a goal requires coordinated execution across multiple agents.

## 🔄 Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Continuous Document Editing

```typescript
// Day 1: Start a document
const space = await XAgent.start("Write my thesis");
await space.uploadArtifact("thesis.md", initialContent);
await xAgent.chat("Write the introduction");

// Day 2: Continue refining
const space = await XAgent.resume("thesis-space-id");
await xAgent.chat("Make the abstract more concise");

// Day 3: Final polish
await xAgent.chat("Review everything and fix any issues");
```

### Pattern 2: Iterative Code Review

```typescript
const space = await XAgent.start("Review my PR");
await space.uploadArtifact("changes.diff", diffContent);
await xAgent.chat("Review this code for security issues");
// XAgent remembers findings...
await xAgent.chat("Now check for performance issues");
// Context accumulates...
await xAgent.chat("Generate a summary of all issues found");
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Session Research

```typescript
// Session 1: Gather sources
await xAgent.chat("Research climate change impacts on agriculture");
// Artifacts created: sources.md, notes.md

// Session 2: Analyze
await xAgent.chat("Synthesize the research into key findings");
// Artifacts updated: findings.md

// Session 3: Write
await xAgent.chat("Write a report based on our findings");
// Artifacts created: report.md
```

## 🛡️ Data Persistence

Unlike ephemeral task runners, VibeX persists everything:

- **Conversation History**: Every message across all sessions
- **Artifact Versions**: Full history of document changes
- **Agent Decisions**: Audit trail of all agent actions
- **Context State**: Variables, preferences, and configuration

This enables:

- **Resume anytime**: Pick up where you left off
- **Rollback**: Restore previous artifact versions
- **Audit**: Review the complete history of changes
- **Learning**: Agents can reference past decisions

## 🚀 Getting Started with Design Docs

1. **Read [System Architecture](/docs/design/architecture)** - Understand the Space model
2. **Explore [Space Lifecycle](/docs/design/task-lifecycle)** - See how work evolves
3. **Dive into specific areas**:
   - Building tools? See [Tool Execution](/docs/design/tool-execution)
   - Managing state? Check [Memory](/docs/design/memory)
   - Integrating systems? Review [Communication](/docs/design/communication)

## 🤝 Contributing to Design
