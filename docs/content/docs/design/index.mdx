# VibeX Design & Architecture

Welcome to the VibeX design documentation! This section provides comprehensive technical insights into how VibeX works internally, its architectural decisions, and the principles that guide its development.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

VibeX is built as a lightweight micro-kernel that orchestrates specialized agents in a secure, observable, and scalable manner. The system transforms complex user requests into coordinated multi-agent workflows with complete auditability.

### Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns** - Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Centralized Orchestration** - Unified control plane for coordination and security
- **Agent Autonomy** - Agents manage their own reasoning with private Brains
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Asynchronous, structured communication
- **Configuration-Driven** - Declarative team and workflow definitions
- **Security by Design** - Audited, policy-enforced external interactions
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - User-scoped organizational separation (requires external auth for security)
- **Taskspace Isolation** - Version-controlled, reproducible task environments

## 📚 Design Documentation

### [System Architecture](/design/overview)

Complete architectural overview covering the four-layer system design, collaboration models, and execution patterns. Includes detailed sequence diagrams and component interactions.

### [Multi-Tenant Architecture](/design/multi-tenant-security)

Organizational separation architecture for multi-tenant deployments, covering user isolation patterns, taskspace segregation, and required authentication integration for secure deployments.

### [State and Context Management](/design/state-and-context)

Deep dive into how VibeX manages state, context, and memory across agents and tasks. Covers taskspace isolation, memory systems, and context propagation.

### [Tool Execution](/design/tool-execution)

Detailed explanation of the secure tool execution system, including validation, sandboxing, and the tool self-correction mechanism that enables reliable agent tool usage.

### [Communication Patterns](/design/communication)

Event-driven communication architecture, message passing patterns, and how agents coordinate through the orchestrator and event bus.

## 🎯 Key Architectural Components

### TaskExecutor

The primary workflow engine that owns the end-to-end lifecycle of tasks, manages taskspace provisioning, and coordinates agent invocations.

### Lead

The stateful "Project Manager" of the task. Creates a plan, assigns micro-tasks to specialist agents, and tracks progress to drive the workflow forward. Ships with a default implementation that uses LLM-based intelligent routing.

### Specialist Agents

Stateless, single-purpose experts defined by prompt files. Each agent has one clear responsibility (planning, research, writing, etc.) and is invoked by the Lead to perform specific micro-tasks. VibeX includes a standard library of common agents.

### Agent Brain

The reasoning engine that powers each agent. Handles LLM interactions, tool calling, and response generation with streaming support.

## 🔄 Execution Modes

VibeX supports two primary execution patterns:

- **Autonomous Execution** - Fire-and-forget mode ideal for production workflows
- **Interactive Execution** - Step-by-step control for debugging and human-in-the-loop scenarios

## 🛡️ Security & Observability

Every interaction in VibeX is:

- **Auditable** - Complete event logging of all decisions and actions
- **Secure** - Sandboxed tool execution with policy enforcement
- **Observable** - Real-time monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Reproducible** - Version-controlled taskspaces and deterministic execution
